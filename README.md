# Square-1-Squarefree

This project aims to solve the following problem (https://projecteuler.net/problem=864)

Let $C(n)$ be the number of squarefree integers of the form $x^2 + 1$ such that $1 \le x \le n$.For example, $C(10) = 9$ and $C(1000) = 895$.Find $C(123567101113)$.

After some hours trying to solve the problem, the final algorithm can not solve this equation, because of limitation in the available memory.

The problem will be left for future improving
